# BasicScale_ICM

Technical Research Project


For my technical research project, I have aimed to get a basic understanding of using the Maximilian sound library. I have chosen to investigate Maximilian because I would like to create my own music in c++. To achieve this I would like to build various instruments using the Maximillian library. For this particular assignment, I have built a scale starting at 25 Hz, going up to 105 Hz. I have also included an ADSR envelope which controls the attack, decay, sustain and release rate of the oscillators. In my code I have a slow release time to create an ambient sound. The low Hz combined with the triangle wave creates an eerie sounding instrument. Enjoy!
